# 🧠 The Ecology of Thought

*A simulation of innovation vs. imitation in the evolution of ideas.*

---

## 📌 Overview

This project is a **NetLogo agent-based model** designed to explore how societies progress—or stagnate—in a complex landscape of ideas.

It simulates the collective behavior of "Thinkers" (agents with individual personalities and memories) as they explore a **fitness landscape**. The model highlights the trade-off between:

- **Innovation**: Risky search for new, better ideas  
- **Imitation**: Safe reliance on successful or popular ideas  

The simulation serves as a conceptual and visual laboratory to examine when breakthroughs happen and when intellectual conformity prevails.

## 🌄 Core Concept

- **Environment**: A 2D landscape where each point represents an idea, and elevation represents its quality.
- **Agents**: "Thinkers" navigating this space, guided by cognitive and social rules.
- **Goal**: Reveal when societies achieve intellectual progress and when they stagnate.

## 🧠 Agent Design

### 🧬 Personality Traits

Each agent has two fixed traits:

- `innovation-propensity` (Red): Tendency to explore and take risks
- `imitation-propensity` (Blue): Tendency to imitate and conform

The dominant trait determines the agent’s behavior at each time step.

### 🧠 Memory

- Each agent remembers the **best idea it has ever seen** (`best-idea-I-know`)
- If their current idea is worse, they may revert to the remembered one depending on a probability called `conservatism`

## 👥 Social Learning

### 🧭 Imitation Strategies

Agents that choose to imitate follow one of two rules:

- **Imitate Success** (Meritocracy): Copy the best-performing peer  
- **Imitate Conformity** (Groupthink): Copy the most *popular* idea in sight

### 🌐 Network Topologies

Defines how agents are socially connected:

- **Proximity Network**: Local influence from nearby agents  
- **Scale-Free Network**: Global influence via highly connected hubs (like social media influencers)

## 🌟 Emergent Phenomena

| Phenomenon            | Description |
|-----------------------|-------------|
| **Local Optimum Trap**  | Society finds a “good enough” idea and stops innovating |
| **"Eureka!" Cascade**   | One discovery causes a rapid shift in collective ideas |
| **Conformity Trap**     | Popular but mediocre ideas dominate due to imitation bias |
| **Network Effects**     | Proximity networks lead to fragmentation; scale-free networks lead to global convergence (positive or negative) |
